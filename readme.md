OptiTrack VRPN ROS-Client
===================

This is an extension of https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/vrpn_client_ros to compute both **position** and **velocity** of rigid bodies.

Tested in Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS jade.

Note: in order to have a proper configuration, all the rigid bodies set in Motive (OptiTrack Software) should not include a "space" in their names. E.g. RigidBody_1
